<h1>Mail Web Admin</h1>
Welcome to the mail admin interface. Here is a small HowTo, you should
understand what you are doing!

<h2>Virtual Domains</h2>
Add new virtual domains in the <a href="/domains">Virtual Domains section</a>.
If your DNS settings are correct (i.e. mails for your domain example.com
are processed by your mailsever) you have to add it as a virtual domain.</p>
So simply add example.com as a new virtual domain in order to generate mailing
accounts like user@example.com

<h2>Virtual Users</h2>
Virtual Users are all the mailing accounts you receive mails for. See the
<a href="/users">Virtual Users Section</a> to add new mailing users.</p>
On this site all mailing accounts available are listed. This also includes
&quot;accounts&quot; that are just an alias for another account, i.e.
all mails to that account are forwarded to another address.
See section Aliases for more details about aliases.

<h3>Aliases</h3>
An alias is used to forward mails for an email account to another email. This
other email must not be on the same sever but could be any valid email address.
There are two ways you can add aliases:
<dl>
  <dt>Only alias:</dt>
  <dd>In this case the email is just forwarded to another mail adress,
  for example: All mails to info@example.com should be forwarded to admin@example.com
  Don't create an user account for info@example.com, just add an alias
  info@example.com &#x2192; admin@example.com
  </dd>
  <dt>Alias that also receives a copy</dt>
  <dd>To forward all emails from info@example.com
    to admin@example.com but have info@example.com to also receive emails
    (stored on disk): Add a user info@example.com and than add an alias
    info@example.com &#x2192; admin@example.com
  </dd>
</dl>
There can be more than one alias for one emails address. If you want
to forward all emails to info@example.com to peter@example.com and susie@example.com
add two aliases: info@example.com &#x2192; peter@example.com and
info@example.com &#x2192; susie@example.com
</p>
Catch all aliases are not supported since they're always a bad idea.
